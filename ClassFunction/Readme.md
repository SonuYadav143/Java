classes and objects are fundamental concepts that form the basis of object-oriented programming. Here's a detailed explanation of classes and objects:

1.  Class: A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating instances of objects with similar characteristics. A class encapsulates data (member variables) and behaviors (methods) related to a specific entity or concept.

Syntax of a class declaration:

public class ClassName {
    // Member variables (fields)
    // Constructors
    // Methods
}
Here's an example of a class named Person:

public class Person {
    // Member variables (fields)
    String name;
    int age;

    // Constructors
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Methods
    public void introduce() {
        System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
    }
}



In this example, we create two objects (person1 and person2) of the Person class using the new keyword. We pass the name and age values as arguments to the constructor when creating the objects. We then call the introduce() method on each object to print their introductions.

Objects provide a way to model and represent real-world entities or concepts in code. By defining classes and creating objects, you can organize your code into reusable and logical units. Each object maintains its own state and behavior, allowing you to work with multiple instances of the same class independently.
